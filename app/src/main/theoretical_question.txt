 1 pro and 1 con for each of the 2 implementation ways of storing tokens:

 As a client, at the first time you got a token. You have 2 options:
 a. save the token locally (for example in a file or in SP)
 b. use this token only in this current app-launch, and re-request a token from the server each time the app launches again

 a:
 pro: easy to save and use. less requests from server.
 con: if someone will get there hand on this token the requests will not be secure any more at all.

 b:
 pro: more secure because we don't use same token every time so the server can verify the client's
  identity before doing any change with more chances it's the right client.
 con: more requests from server.
